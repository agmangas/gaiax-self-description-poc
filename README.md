# Gaia-X Self-Descriptions

A simple proof of concept of the process to build and sign a Self-Description using the [Gaia-X Compliance Service](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance).

The main contribution of this repository is demonstrating how to programmatically build [Gaia-X Self-Description](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/gaia-x_trust_framework/#gaia-x-self-description) documents, which are then validated by the [Gaia-X Lab Compliance API](https://compliance.lab.gaia-x.eu/v1-staging/docs). We leverage the fact that Letâ€™s Encrypt is able to issue free certificates signed by a [valid Trust Anchor](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/trust_anchors/#list-of-defined-trust-anchors), ensuring compliance without incurring extra costs.

## Prerequisites

### Running in a Docker container

* A Linux server with _sudo_ access that has ports 80 and 443 exposed to the Internet.
* A public DNS domain that points to the IP address of the previous Linux server.
* Docker.
* [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).

### Running with local development tools

* The prerequisites above.
* [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

## Usage

First you need to update the configuration to match your environment. Copy the file `.env.default` from this repository to `.env` and, at least, update the following variables:

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CERTBOT_DOMAIN`        | The domain name of your server for which you want to generate the Let's Encrypt certificate.                                                                                                                                          |
| `CERTBOT_EMAIL`         | The email of the owner of the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `RESOURCE_OPENAPI_SPEC` | This variable should point to an OpenAPI schema that describes the HTTP API that you want to model as a [Gaia-X Resource](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/resource_and_subclasses/#virtual-resource). |

### Running in a Docker container

To simplify the process, we recommend creating a shell alias that will run the Docker container with the correct parameters. You can create this alias by copying and pasting the command generated by the following task, which first builds the Docker image:

```console
$ task build-show-runner-alias

[...]

ðŸ“‹ Copy and paste the following command to create the alias:

alias gaia-x='docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 -p 443:443 [...]'
```

You should run the commands the rest of commands in this guide from the directory where the `.env` file is located.

Request the certificates with the following command:

```console
$ gaia-x get-certs
```

This will generate the certificates and store them in the `certs` folder.

Generate the DID with the following command:

```console
$ gaia-x build-did
```

Generate the Verifiable Credentials with the following command:

```console
$ gaia-x build-credentials
```

You can now build submit the resulting Verifiable Presentation to the Compliance API:

```console
$ gaia-x build-vp
```

Alternatively, you can create a container image that will generate the Verifiable Presentation and submit it to the Compliance API every time it is run:

```console
$ gaia-x build-credential-server-image
```

This will create a file named `image.tar` in the current directory. You can load this image into your Docker daemon with the following command:

```console
$ docker load -i image.tar
```

You can now run the container with the following command:

```console
docker run -it --rm -p 443:443 gaiax-credential-server
```

### Running with local development tools

Install the dependencies and request the certificates with the following commands:

```console
$ npm install
$ sudo task get-certs
```

This will generate the certificates and store them in the `certs` folder.

Generate the DID with the following command:

```console
$ task build-did
```

Generate the Verifiable Credentials with the following command:

```console
$ task build-credentials
```

You can now build submit the resulting Verifiable Presentation to the Compliance API:

```console
$ task build-vp
```

Alternatively, you can create a container image that will generate the Verifiable Presentation and submit it to the Compliance API every time it is run:

```console
$ task build-credential-server-image
```

This will build a Docker image named `gaiax-credential-server`. You can now run the container with the following command:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm -p 443:443 gaiax-credential-server
```
